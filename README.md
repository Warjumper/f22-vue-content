# Fall 2022 Vue Content

We will use this repo and a set of branches for the first steps of learning
VueJS and the basics of javascript frameworks.

Go to the bottom of this file for Eslint and Prettier Information

## Branches

- main branch:
  - Most boiler plate code removed
  - Tailwind Added
- utils branch:
  - prettier and eslint configured for a minimally intrusive but helpful
    workflow
- develop branch:
  - based on utils, where we will work on code in class

## Purpose of this Repo

- To store our in class examples
- To provide a place to explore and experiment

## Notes

Keep in mind that in this repo we are using [Vue](https://vuejs.org). Later we
will switch to [NuxtJS](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) which is built around Vue. Nuxt
automates a lot of things that we do manually in Vue.

Remember to check the [Vue Docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) when
you run into difficulties.

## Eslint and Prettier

- [This guide will be enough to get you going](https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/eslint-and-prettier-with-vite-and-vue-js-3/)
- [This will help you set up the tailwind prettier plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier)
- Note the .json config files and the .ignore files used for eslint and prettier
- If it's not autoformatting, check
  [these settings](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DINkP.png) and make sure to
  configure the default formatter
